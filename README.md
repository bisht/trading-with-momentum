This project was done as part of Udacity Nanodegree program.
In this project, a momentum based trading strategy is developed-and-tested to see if it has the potential to be profitable. 
A simple scheme is used to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. 
The trading signal is then computed for the time range given and applied to the dataset to produce projected returns. 
Finally, a statistical test on the mean of the returns is used to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.
